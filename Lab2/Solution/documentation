What is the purpose of each method in the monitor?

There are a total of 3 methods in the monitor class. We implemented a enter method, a leave method and a tryEnter methode.

enter: this method does basically what the acquire did for the semaphores. If the section we want to enter is free (isTaken is false),enter the section. If it is currently taken (isTaken is true) wait until we can take it.
leave: this method does basically what rhe realease did for semaphores. If we leave a section set the isTaken to false and signal all the threads which are waiting.
tryEnter: has basically same functionality as tryAcquire of the semaphres. Use the tryLock to make sure we do an atomic operation (if multiple threads call tryEnter). Check isTaken and if it's false call the enter method before returning a true and unlocking the trylock.

How many conditional variables, if any, are needed in your solution? Justify your answer.
We are using one condition. We only need one because there can only be one train on a track at one time unit.
